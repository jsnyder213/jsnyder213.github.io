                <h2>Artifact Description:</h2>
                <p>This artifact was a group project for the Interaction Design class within the ISLT program. My group and I were tasked with redesigning an existing interface 
                implementing interaction design principles to streamline the processes, cutdown on cognitive load, and just improve the user interaction altogether.<p>
                For this project, my team and I worked on redesigning the MU payment portal. 
                This project stemmed from our own frustrations with how the website handled user interaction. 
                This project focuses on the collaborative work and performance support aspects of Objective 1.1. 
                Additionally, in this project I took on a project management role. Driving the team to stay organized, communicating overall goals and objectives, ensuring we were sticking to our
                timeline and meeting expected deadlines, and lastly delegating team responsibilities. Artifact 3 meets the objective of 1.3. 
                </p>
                <h2>Artifact Reflection:</h2>
                <p>
                Overall this was an enjoyable project and really helped me to further capitalize on my professional strengths. 
                In my day-to-day job, I am a project manager of sorts, helping to implement big changes or create new processes and procedures within 
                the department. I feel I led the team well and we were able to meet the expectations and requirements for the assignment in time for 
                every deadline. We used feedback throughout the course to help drive our design decisions and were only really limited by our inability 
                to create a very high-end prototype. (None of us had much coding background, so we couldnâ€™t really implement a robust application)
                </p>
                <p>
                For this project, I was also able to rely on my creative side and was the primary designer of the overall look and function. 
                Again, really allowing me to play to my strengths and grow myself as a professional.
