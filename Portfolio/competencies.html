                <h1>COMPETENCIES, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROGRAM:</h1>
                <h2>Competency 1: Design and Development of learning systems.</h2>
                <p><em>(student)I am able to design and devlop innovative, aesthetic, effective and sustainable learning
                technologies based on theory-grounded research.</em></p> 
                <h3>Goal 1: To provide students with experiences to develop theory-grounded and research based competencies
                    for the innovative, aesthetic, effective and sustainable design/development and management of technologies
                    for learning opportunities and system.</h3>
                    <h4><em>Objective 1.1:</em></h4>
                    <p>Students are able to design/develop learning and performance opportunities and systems 
                    including direct instruction, constructivist learning, collaborative work, and performance support.</p>
                    <h4><em>Objective 1.2:</em></h4>
                    <p>Students are able to design/develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online
                    learning environments; and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners.
                    </p>
                    <h4><em>Objective 1.3:</em></h4>
                    <p>Students are able to conduct project management activities for both design/development, and implementation of

                    </p>
                <h2>Competency 2: Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation</h2>
                <p><em>(student)I developed critical and analytical skills for data collection and evaluation and can reflect and apply
                these skills to assess and evaluate learning systems.</em></p>
                <h3>Goal 2: To provide students with experiences to develop skills in data collection, analysis and evaluation for reflecting
                    on and applying to the design/development of learning opportunities and systems.</h3>
                    <h4><em>Objective 2.1:</em></h4>
                    <p>Students are able to conduct analysis in order to translate and use theoretical frameworks and existing research to design/develop
                        learning opportunities and systems.</p>
                    <h4><em>Objective 2.2:</em></h4>
                    <p>Students are able to manage and optimize analytics collect by learning and performance systems to develop criteria to
