                <h2>Artifact Description:</h2>
                <p>This artifact was an individual assignment for the Research Methods course work. 
                Throughout the semester I learned research methods and ideology, to end the course with a completed research  proposal, with the potential to submit for continued 
                research work and funding.
                This artifact achieves objectives 2.1 and 2.2(noted in below reflection) by showcasing the use of existing research and theoretical frameworks to guide 
                me along as I worked through and developed my potential research proposal. 
                Additionally, this artifact, and the principles learned from the class have shaped my future progression and professional development. 
                </p>

                <h2>Artifact Reflection:</h2>
                <p>
                Admittedly, I never had any intention to focus my career on research, however, I understand the importance of it in academia. 
                After this class I had limited exposure to the research field, but the foundation that was created helped me feel confident in approaching the subject with a bit
                more understanding. Inevitably leading me to participate in an ongoing research project.
                <p>
                Connecting to Objective 2.2 - Throughout this ISLT coursework, I have been able to use my expertise in my field (medical simulation) to engage with colleagues on a
                VR based learning module and research project. Together, we have developed a VR learning module for 1st year nursing students to practice a patient-based encounter before they are expected to do a physical patient-based encounter (as a part of their curriculum). The nature of this project is to collect and analyze data through the use of virtual reality to help measure the learning impact of a virtual “trial” compared to the expected physical application. 
                <p>This artifact is a representation of the progression of myself to showcase my ability to translate existing research and frameworks, 
                into a working project that capitalizes on the use of technology (VR), and then synthesize and process the collected data to improve learning. 
                Ideally, using these findings to help shape the way learners can engage with education in an accessible and meaningful way.
