                <h2>Professional:</h2>
                <p> When I first started this master’s program, my intention was to use it to advance my career within the University system. 
                    I knew that to move into an associate director, or even a director position I would need a master’s degree. 
                    Earlier this year, I achieved my original goal and have since been promoted in my department to an Associate Director position.
                    <br>
                    <br>The processes and subjects I have learned throughout this program have helped me to elevate my thinking within my department. 
                    Giving me the tools, I need to analyze some of the processes and policies we have in place, as well as plan for future growth and keep pushing the department in a forward motion. 
                    <br>
                    <br>Additionally, after taking an intro to research class and an intro to virtual reality class. 
                    I have been able to use my work environment as inspiration to collaborate with Doctoral students and create a virtual reality learning experience that we have turned into a research project.
                        
                </p>
                <h2>Personal:</h2>
                <p> Working in the field I am in; I interact with technology daily. This program has given me insight in designing learning content to enrich the learners experience as well as
                    ensure the content that is being delivered is presented in an understandable and impactful way. 
                    I have been able to use some of the course work to better my daily work, specifically after taking a project management class. 
                    That class gave me the tools I needed to really rethink how I process projects at work (as well as outside of work) and gave me the knowledge to 
                    complete the projects in a way that really provides strong deliverables to all involved. I strive to continue to educate myself and grow as a human, this program
                    has helped with that personal goal tremendously.  
                </p>
                <h2>Future:</h2>
                <p>At this point in my life, my future is wide open. Upon graduation I look forward to taking some time to relax, eventually focusing on the next steps in my 
                    career and using the skills and knowledge I have gained to bring about positive changes and processes to my department. I have already started to implement some
                    of the theories and practices in my day to day work, specifically in instances of project management and looking at our processes and procedures
                    with a more critical and analytical view. Additionally, I am working more with the TELL (Technology to Enhance Learning Lab) Research group at Mizzou to brainstorm future VR related research projects.
                    I am also using this experience to show my daughter it is never a bad thing to push yourself through hard things and to continue to grow and learn. I look forward to the future and all the possibilities that 
                    still lie ahead of me.
