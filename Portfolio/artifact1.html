                <h2>Artifact Description:</h2>
                <p>This project was a group project for the Intro to VR course. My partner and
                    I were tasked with creating a Virtual Reality Learning Experience (VRLE) with 
                    at least 4 rooms. Our project subject was focused on building a VRLE that could be used
                    with special needs learners, specifically geared toward social awareness activities.
                    My partner and I took on a split role with us both contributing equal amounts of responsibility. 
                    Those duties included: Layout and desing,3D modeling, content write-up, discussion postings, 
                    and the eventual group presentation to the class.
                </p>
                <h2>Artifact Reflection:</h2>
                <p>In my opinion, the content of this project is a wonderful example of how technology, specifically VR, can be used
                    to help reach and educate students (as well as parents) who may struggle with social situations. The concept of this project
                    was to create a world where these students along with teachers and parents can interact in socially charged environments.
                    As an example, we built a mockup of a "party room" or a large classroom. Everyday settings that may present over stimulation for these learners
                    allowing them to overcome anxieties and learn different ways to react and control the situation for themselves.
