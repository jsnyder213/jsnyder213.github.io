                <p>Hello, my name is Jason Snyder and welcome to my Information Science and Learning Technologies web portfolio.
                    The purpose of this site is to showcase some of the projects/jobs and accomplishments I have worked through during my course work in the ISLT Masterâ€™s program at the 
                    University of Missouri. The goal of this site is recap some of the learning objectives presented over the past 2 years and align them with the assignments/projects
                    I worked on for the courses, showcasing the result and what I learned during the process. 
                    The objective of the website will be to present an accumulation of the work I put into the program and will be presented upon graduation to meet the final requirement 
                    of the Learning Technologies Portfolio.
                </p>
