                <p>My name is Jason Snyder and welcome to my Information Science and Learning Technologies web portfolio.
                    The purpose of this site is to showcase some of the projects I have worked on throughout my course work in the ISLT Master’s program at the 
                    University of Missouri. The goal of this site is to recap some of the learning objectives presented over the past 2 years and align them with the assignments/projects
                    I worked on for the courses, showcasing the result and what I learned during the process. 
                    The objective of the website will be to present an accumulation of the work I put into the program and will be presented upon graduation to meet the final requirement 
                    of the Learning Technologies Portfolio.
                </p> 
                <p> I have recently been promoted to an Associate Director position within my department. That department being a medical simulation center within the School of Medicine at the University of Missouri. 
                    I have a Bachelor of Science from Middle Tennessee State University, with an emphasis in Mass Communication/Computer Animation. 
                    I am on track to complete my master’s degree in Information Science and Learning Technologies from the University of Missouri in the fall of 2022.
                </p>
                <p> In my free time, I enjoy playing board and video games, drawing, cooking, making mead, and hanging out with my family. I am working on making
                    a campsite on some family property, with the idea to cut my own timber to make a small shelter on site. It's a fun little project and something that 
                    is a real challenge as I have never done anything like it before.
