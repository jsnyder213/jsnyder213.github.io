      <p><h2>Hello, my name is Jason Snyder and welcome to my Information Science & Learning Technologies web portfolio.</h2>
      The purpose of this site is to showcase some of the projects and accomplishments I have worked through during my course work in the ISLT Masterâ€™s program at the 
      University of Missouri. The goal of this site is recap some of the learning objectives presented over the past 2 years and align them with the assignments/projects
      I worked on for the courses, showcasing the result and what I learned during the process. 
      The objectvie of the website will be to present an accumulation of the work I put into the program and will be presented upon graduation to meet the final requirement 
      of the Learning Technologies Portfolio. 
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting and please enjoy.</p>
