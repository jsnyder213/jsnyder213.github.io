        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>Although I have never done this "professionally" I am an artist and have ventured into digital art and graphic design throughout my years. Recently I did some minor graphic design work
                for a local micro brewery (<a href="https://buroakbeer.com/" target="_blank">BurOak</a>) here in middle Missouri. This was a HUGE accomplishment for myself! As I stated, I have never done anything like this 
                professionally but I have an artistc background and working on a project like this was an amazing experience.</p>
        <p>For this project the brewery needed a label for beer that they had just developed, and at the time they had no artist on staff. I frequent the space to hangout and do art, eventually posting on social media. 
                they really appreciated the artwork and my style and reached out for a possible collabration. I have a undergradute degree in Computer Animation and during that course work, i had done digital illustrations, but 
                that had been many years ago. This project allowed me to revisit some of that knowledge and apply those long forgotten skills.</p>
        <p>After completion of the label, I contuined to "work" with them on various artistic endevars such as art for their social media and a bandana design.</p>
