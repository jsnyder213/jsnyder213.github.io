            <p>I am currently the Operation Manager of a medical simulation center within the School of Medicine at the University of Missouri. 
                I have a Bachelor of Science from Middle Tennessee State University, with an emphasis in Mass Communication/Computer Animation. 
                I am on track to complete my master’s degree in Information Science & Learning Technologies from the University of Missouri in the fall of 2022. 
               <br>In my free time, I enjoy playing board and video games, drawing, cooking, making mead, and hanging out with my family. I am working on making
                a campsite on some family property, with the idea to cut my own timber to make a small shelter on site. It's a fun little project and something that 
                is a real challenge as I have never done anything like it before. 
              </p>
              <blockquote><strong><em>“Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.” -Yoda</em></strong></blockquote>
              <p> Currently my job is heavily focused on technology, education, and the merging of the two making this master program a perfect fit for my future
                goals within the University. I am hoping to use this degree to advance my career into a Director or Associate Director position in my department. </p>
