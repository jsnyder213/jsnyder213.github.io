      <p><h2>Hello, my name is Jason Snyder and welcome to my Information Science & Learning Technologies web portfolio.</h2>
      The purpose of this site is to showcase some of the projects and accomplishments I have worked through during my course work in the ISLT Master’s program at the 
      University of Missouri. The goal of this site is recap some of the learning objectives presented over the past 2 years and align them with the assignments/projects
      I worked on for the courses, showcasing the result and what I learned during the process. 
      The objectvie of the website will be to present an accumulation of the work I put into the program and will be presented upon graduation to meet the final requirement 
      of the Learning Technologies Portfolio.

   Hello. My name is Jason and I currently live in Fulton Missouri with my wife and daughter. <br>
    We have 2 dogs and a cat. I am the Operations Manager of a medical simulation center within the University of Missouri… basically I make sure all the technology works properly. 
    I enjoy playing board and video games, drawing, cooking, making mead, and hanging out with my family.<br>
    I have an undergraduate degree in computer animation and fine art. I am working on my Information Science & Learning Technology master’s at the University of Missouri 
    hoping to use this degree to further advance myself professionally. <br> 
    My job is heavily focused on technology, education, and the merging of the two so this major makes the most sense.
