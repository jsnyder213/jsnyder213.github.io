                <h2>2016 - Current: Operations Manager</h2>
                <p> My current job is the Operations Manager with the <a href="https://medicine.missouri.edu/centers-institutes-labs/shelden-simulation-center" target="_blank"> Shelden clinical simulation center</a> 
                    at the University of Missouri. I have been with the simulation center for going on 6 years, starting at a simulation technican and advanceing myself into my current role as Operations manager.
                    As the operations manager I am involved in the general day to day functionality of the center, this includes (but is not limited to)</P>
                    <h2>Job Duties:</h2>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Tech support</li>

                <p>In this position I also manage a team of 3 people, as well as assit the director in the management of the department as a whole. Aside from the various responsibilities I have, that challenge me daily,
                    one of the best aspects of this job is the technical work I do. I am responsibile for the upkeep and maintance of the center's high-fidelty simulators. These robots are used to help 
                    the center accomplish the mission of medical education in a safe and responbile learning environment. </p>

                <h2>2009 - 2016: State of Missouri</h2>
                <p>For years I worked at the state in various helpdesk/technical positions, going from an Information Techologist
                    moving up to an Information Technology Specialist. I ended my career with the state (before moving to the University)
                    at the Department of Conservation. Throughout the years with the state my responsibilities ranged from: telecommunications, 
                    statewide wireless contracts and services, IT helpdesk, implementation of statewide phones systems, software development and packaging, network admistration, and many others.</p>
                <p>The experience gained from this time with the state gave me the confidence to move to my current position with the University, with a lot
                    of the past experience being directly tied to some of my current responisbilities.

                <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
                <p>Although I have never done this "professionally" I am an artist and have ventured into digital art and graphic design throughout my years. Recently I did some minor graphic design work
                    for a local micro brewery (<a href="https://buroakbeer.com/" target="_blank">BurOak</a>) here in middle Missouri. This was a HUGE accomplishment for myself! As I stated, I have never done anything like this 
                    professionally but I have an artistc background and working on a project like this was an amazing experience.</p>
                <p>For this project the brewery needed a label for beer that they had just developed, and at the time they had no artist on staff. I frequent the space to hangout and do art, eventually posting on social media. 
                    they really appreciated the artwork and my style and reached out for a possible collabration. I have a undergradute degree in Computer Animation and during that course work, i had done digital illustrations, but 
                    that had been many years ago. This project allowed me to revisit some of that knowledge and apply those long forgotten skills.</p>
                <p>After completion of the label, I contuined to "work" with them on various artistic endevars such as art for their social media and a bandana design.</p>
