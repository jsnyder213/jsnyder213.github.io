    <title>Welcome to Jason's Website</title>

    Hello. My name is Jason and I currently live in Fulton Missouri with my wife and daughter. <br>
    We have 2 dogs and a cat. I am the Operations Manager of a medical simulation center within the University of Missouri… basically I make sure all the technology works properly. 
    I enjoy playing board and video games, drawing, cooking, making mead, and hanging out with my family.<br>
    I have an undergraduate degree in computer animation and fine art. I am working on my Information Science & Learning Technology master’s at the University of Missouri 
    hoping to use this degree to further advance myself professionally. <br> 
    My job is heavily focused on technology, education, and the merging of the two so this major makes the most sense.
