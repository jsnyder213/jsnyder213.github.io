                    <h2>Professional:</h2>
                    <p> Professionally I am on solid trajectory to achieve my career goals of becoming an Associate Director in my department within the next 2 years.
                         A major reason for my completion of this Masterâ€™s program is to move myself forward in my career within the University, and I see no hurrdles to accomplish this.
                         This program has given me the opportunity to continue to expand on my skill set and provided me with material to look at learning and technology in a different way. 
                         This is having positive changes with my career as I rethink how to approach operational issues within the Sim Center. <br>
                        Additionally, after taking an intro to research class and an intro to virtual reality class. 
                        I have been able to use my work environment as inspiration to collaborate with Doctoral students and create a virtual reality learning experience 
                        that we have turned into a research project.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Personal:</h2>
                    <p> Working in the field I am in; I interact with technology daily. 
                        This program has given me insight in designing learning content to enrich the learners experience as well as ensure the content that is being delivered is presented in an understandable and impactful way. 
                        I have been able to use some of the course work to better my daily work, specifically after taking a project management class. 
                        That class gave me the tools I needed to really rethink how I process projects at work (as well as outside of work) and gave me the knowledge to 
                        complete the projects in a way that really provides strong deliverables to all involved. I strive to contuine to educate myself and grow as a human, this program
                        has helped with that personal goal tremendously.  
                    </p>
                    <h2>Future:</h2>
                    <p>At this point in my life, my future is wide open. Upon graduation I look forward to taking some time to relax, eventually focusing on the next steps in my 
                        career and using the skills and knowlegdge I have gained to bring about positive changes and processes to my department. I am also using this experience to show my
                        daughter it is never a bad thing to push yourself through hard things and to contuine to grow and learn. I look forward to the future and all the possibilites that 
                        still lie ahead of me.
